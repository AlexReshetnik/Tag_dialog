# Tag_dialog
During the development of projects, it was often necessary to copy and peek at parts of the code from past projects, so 
  I saved everything on the PC, and in git everything was in one repository (AllProjectForStyding), now 
  I sorted everything and created a separate repository

Practiced with the html tag <dialog> created a beautiful scroll
